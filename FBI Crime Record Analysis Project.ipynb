Both models demonstrated strong predictive performance by successfully capturing seasonal patterns, lag dependencies, and nonlinear relationships in the historical crime data.\n","\n","However, comparative evaluation revealed that LightGBM slightly outperformed XGBoost in terms of forecast stability, computational efficiency, and consistency across crime categories. LightGBM produced smoother predictions and handled feature-engineered time-series inputs more efficiently, making it particularly suitable for multi-series monthly crime forecasting.\n","\n","XGBoost also delivered accurate and reliable forecasts, though it showed marginally higher sensitivity to short-term fluctuations and required slightly more computational resources.\n","\n","Overall, LightGBM emerged as the most effective model for high-frequency crime forecasting in this project, while XGBoost remains a strong and dependable alternative.

Certain crime types and neighbourhoods consistently contribute higher crime volumes, while seasonal peaks occur predictably across years. Forecast visualizations from LightGBM, XGBoost, and SARIMAX models confirm the continuation of these historical patterns into future periods, validating the reliability of the forecasting models. These findings demonstrate that crime trends are structured and predictable, enabling data-driven decision-making for proactive crime prevention and resource allocation."],"metadata":{"id":"zuNY7mdScTVl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# *Final Conclusion On The Models:*\n","\n","Overall, the implementation and evaluation of LightGBM, XGBoost, and SARIMAX models demonstrated the effectiveness of both machine learning and statistical approaches in forecasting crime trends at different temporal levels. LightGBM emerged as the best-performing model for monthly crime type forecasting due to its superior ability to capture seasonal patterns, temporal dependencies, and nonlinear relationships, while also providing stable and computationally efficient predictions. XGBoost also delivered strong and reliable performance, effectively modeling crime trends and seasonality, though with slightly lower efficiency and stability compared to LightGBM. SARIMAX performed well in forecasting yearly crime counts at the neighbourhood level, successfully capturing long-term trends and producing interpretable and consistent forecasts. While SARIMAX is well-suited for aggregated time-series forecasting, machine learning models such as LightGBM and XGBoost proved more powerful and flexible for high-frequency, feature-rich crime prediction tasks. Overall, the combined use of these models provided a comprehensive and reliable forecasting framework, demonstrating that advanced predictive modeling techniques can effectively support crime trend analysis and data-driven decision-making.\n","\n","This project demonstrates how machine learning and time series forecasting can help improve crime prediction and support data-driven decision making."],"metadata":{"id":"YcI6URS2mBrP"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":["sPiXyZ21lpto","mfUeqp1Bmgdm","zy7BPaujoalh"],"mount_file_id":"1WFbMVIJPj-hvnGS3xu3ZMJ0dN8KIro_A","authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPmADxKpvd5yRYOFfoW71ma"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
